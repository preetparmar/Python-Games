# Welcome to my Snake Game <img src="images/icon.png" width="40" height="35"/>
Being a 90s kid this game is very close to my heart, which is the same for all the 90s generation out there.

I wanted to make this game my own and in process widen my skill and knowledge about python modules.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Put the first step into gaming with python
- Familiarize myself with PyGame Python Module
- Look at various Events in PyGame
- Understand and Implement the complex logic behind the simple looking game

Some notes:
- The two fonts which I have used are saved in fonts folder and am using variables for the folder path.
    - If you wish to use your own fonts then save them and update the variables.
- There are some scenarios which I know needs work on:
    - User can move in the opposite direction, for example the user can go up while it's going down and this causes the game to be over
    - Apple spawns on the snake list
    - Change the speed of the snake as time progresses
- Some additional "Nice to have" features I am working on:
    - Develop a 2nd version on the game where the snake goes out of the boundary and appears on the opposite side.
